Ankusha asks you a question every time. There are 'Yes' and 'No' buttons
provided. Questions are asked from the story of the movie. Click on
either of the buttons, honestly. If the question matches a part of the
movie's story, click 'Yes' or, click 'No'. Ankusha makes a guess after five
questions and confirms with you. If it is the movie you thought of, click on
'Yes' and then press any key on your keyboard to exit. If you click on 'No',
Ankusha goes on continuing for a next set of five questions. This goes on
upto twenty one questions only. Then, you are asked to enter the movie's
name you thought of. End the movie name with an underscore (_).
Finally, press any key on your keyboard to exit. Click 'Q' on your
keyboard to exit.
